You can build package files for Debian based distributions (including Ubuntu)
by running the standard build commands:

  # Install build dependencies
  i="$(dpkg-checkbuilddeps 2>&1 | sed -e 's/.*dependencies: //;t;d')"
  [ -n "$i" ] && sudo apt-get install $i

  # Build package files
  dpkg-buildpackage

These commands replace "./configure" and "make", which you would run on
non-Debian systems.

If you have a very old Debian system, you might have to use "fakeroot
dpkg-buildpackage", instead of just "dpkg-buildpackage".

If you want HTTPS support, and if you want the ability to run "shellinaboxd"
as a non-privileged user, you should now install these run-time libraries:

  sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8 libpam0g openssl

Running "dpkg-buildpackage" puts package files into your parent directory.
You can install them with:

  sudo dpkg -i ../shellinabox_*.deb

You can now connect to your new shell at:

  https://localhost:4200

In contrast to installation by "make install", this package file creates
files that are managed by the system tools. This allows it to install
configuration files in "/etc" and to automatically start the daemon.

You can configure the daemon process by editing "/etc/default/shellinabox".

You can also provide SSL certificates for your site by installing them in
"/var/lib/shellinabox". By default, the system will install self-signed
certificates for you. These certificates are likely to raise warnings when
you point your browser to the site.

At the very least, you need a file called "certificate.pem" that includes
both the private key and the public certificate in PEM (i.e. ASCII) format.
Additionally, you should create files for each of the publicly visible
hostnames that your machine has. These are named "certificate-${FQDN}.pem".
You probably also want "certificate-localhost.pem".

After you make any configuration changes, you need to restart the daemon by
running:

  sudo /etc/init.d/shellinabox restart

If you want to know which files were installed by the package, run

  dpkg -L shellinabox

If you want to uninstall it again, run:

  sudo apt-get remove shellinabox

For all other administrative tasks, refer to the documentation that came
with your system.
