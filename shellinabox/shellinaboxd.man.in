.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B shellinaboxd
daemon implements a webserver that listens on the specified
.IR port .
The web server publishes one or more
.I services
that will be displayed in a VT100 emulator implemented as an AJAX web
application. By default, the port is 4200 and the default service URL is
.IR http://localhost:4200/ .
.P
If no particular
.I service
was requested, the server launches
.B /bin/login
querying the user for their username and password. It then starts the
user's default login shell.
.P
Any modern JavaScript and CSS enabled browser will be able to access the
published
.I service
without requiring additional plugins.
.SH OPTIONS
The following command line parameters control the operation of the daemon:
.TP \w'\-b\ |\ 'u
\fB-b\fP\ | \fB--background\fP[\fB=\fP\fIpidfile\fP]
Launch
.B shellinaboxd
as a background daemon process. Optionally, write the process id to
.IR pidfile .
#ifdef HAVE_OPENSSL
.TP
\fB-c\fP\ |\ \fB--cert=\fP\fIcertdir\fP
If built with SSL/TLS support enabled, the daemon will look in
.I certdir
for any certificates. If unspecified, this defaults to the current
working directory.

If the browser negotiated a
.B Server Name Identification
the daemon will look for a matching
.I certificate-\f[BI]SERVERNAME\fP.pem
file. This allows for virtual hosting of multiple server names on the
same IP address and port.

If no
.B SNI
handshake took place, it falls back on using the certificate in the
.I certificate.pem
file.

The administrator should make sure that there are matching
certificates for each of the virtual hosts on this server, and that
there is a generic
.I certificate.pem
file.

If no suitable certificate is installed,
.B shellinaboxd
will attempt to invoke
.B /usr/bin/openssl
and create a new self-signed certificate. This only succeeds if, after
dropping privileges,
.B shell\%ina\%boxd
has write permissions for
.IR certdir .

Most browsers show a warning message when encountering a self-signed
certificate and then allow the user the option of accepting the
certificate. Due to this usability problem, and due to the perceived
security implications, the use of auto-generated self-signed
certificates is intended for testing or in intranet deployments, only.
.TP
\fB--cert-fd=\fP\fIfd\fP
Instead of providing a
.B --cert
directory, it is also possible to provide a filedescriptor
.I fd
where the certificate and key can be retrieved. While this option disables
.B SNI
support, it does offer an alternative solution for securely providing
the private key data to the daemon.
#endif
.TP
\fB--css=\fP\fIfilename\fP
Sometimes, it is not necessary to replace the entire style sheet using the
.B --static-file
option. But instead a small incremental change should be made to the visual
appearance of the terminal. The
.B --css
option provides a means to append additional style rules to the end of
the default
.B styles.css
sheet. More than one
.B --css
option can be given on the same command line.
.TP
\fB--cgi\fP[\fB=\fP\fIportrange\fP]
Instead of running
.B shellinaboxd
as a permanent process, it can be demand-loaded as a CGI web server
extension. When doing so, it will spawn a server that lives for the
duration of the user's session. If an optional
.I portrange
of the form
.BR MINPORT-MAXPORT
has been provided, the server limits itself to these port numbers. They
should be configured to pass through the firewall.

The
.B --cgi
option is mutually exclusive with the
.BR --background ,
.B --pidfile
and
.B --port
options.

In order to be useful as a CGI script, the
.B shellinaboxd
binary probably will have to be made
.BR setuid-root .
This is currently a discouraged configuration. Use with care.
.TP
\fB-d\fP\ |\ \fB--debug\fP
Enables debugging mode, resulting in lots of log messages on
.IR stderr .
This option is mutually exclusive with
.B --quiet
and
.BR --verbose .
.TP
\fB-f\fP\ |\ \fB--static-file=\fP\fIurl\fP:\fIfile\fP
The daemon serves various built-in resources from URLs underneath the
.I service
mount points. One or more
.B --static-file
options allow for overriding these resources with customized externally
provided
.IR files .
The
.I url
can either be an absolute or a relative path. In the former case, it overrides
exactly one built-in resource for one specific
.IR service ,
whereas in the latter case it overrides resources for each defined
.IR service .

The following resources are available for customization:
.RS
.TP \w'ShellInABox.js\ \ \ 'u
.B beep.wav
audio sample that gets played whenever the terminal BEL is sounded.
.TP
.B favicon.ico
favicon image file that is displayed in the browser's navigation bar.
.TP
.B ShellInABox.js
JavaScript file implementing the AJAX terminal emulator.
.TP
.B styles.css
CSS style file that controls the visual appearance of the terminal.
.TP
.B print-styles.css
CSS style file that controls the visual appearance of printed pages when using
the VT100 transparent printing feature.
.P
It is not recommended to override the root HTML page for a particular
.IR service .
Instead, move the service to an anonymous URL and serve a
.I static-file
that references the
.I service
in an
.IR <iframe> .

Instead of a
.IR file ,
it is possible to provide the name of a directory. This turns
.B shellinaboxd
into a simple web server that publishes all of the files in that
particular directory. This option can be helpful when publishing a more
complex root HTML page.
.RE
.TP
\fB-g\fP\ |\ \fB--group=\fP\fIgid\fP
When started as
.BR root ,
the server drops most privileges at start up. Unless overridden by the
.B --group
option, it switches to
.BR nogroup .

When already running as an unprivileged user, group changes are not
possible.

If running with SSL/TLS support enabled, the certificates must be
accessible to the unprivileged user and/or group that the daemon
runs as.
.TP
\fB-h\fP\ |\ \fB--help\fP
Display a brief usage message showing the valid command line parameters.
.TP
\fB--linkify\fP=[\fBnone\fP|\fBnormal\fP|\fBaggressive\fP]
the daemon attempts to recognize URLs in the terminal output and makes them
clickable. This is not necessarily a fool-proof process and both false
negatives and false positives are possible. By default, only URLs starting
with a well known protocol of
.BR http:// ,\  https:// ,\  ftp:// ,\ or\  mailto:
are recognized. In
.B aggressive
mode, anything that looks like a hostname, URL or e-mail address is
recognized, even if not preceded by a protocol.
.TP
\fB--localhost-only\fP
Normally,
.B shellinaboxd
listens on all available network interfaces. When operating behind a
reverse-proxy that is not always desirable. This command line option
tells the daemon to only listen on the loopback interface.
.TP
\fB--no-beep\fP
not only are audible signals undesired in some working environments, but
browser support for media playback is often buggy, too. Setting this option
suppresses all audio playback and enables the visual bell by default.
.TP
\fB-n\fP\ |\ \fB--numeric\fP
When running in
.B --verbose
mode, the daemon prints an
.IR Apache -style
log file to
.IR stderr .
By default, host names of peers get resolved
before logging them. As DNS look-ups can be expensive, it is possible
to request logging of numeric IP addresses, instead.
.TP
\fB--pidfile=\fP\fIpidfile\fP
The
.B shellinaboxd
daemon can be configured to store its process identifier in
.IR pidfile .
.TP
\fB-p\fP\ |\ \fB--port=\fP\fIport\fP
Unless overridden by this option, the web server listens on port 4200
for incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests.

.B shellinaboxd
can distinguish between SSL/TLS requests and unencrypted requests. It
also knows how to negotiate
.B Server Name
.BR Identification ,
allowing the use of a single port for all types of requests even when
virtual hosting.
.TP
\fB-s\fP\ |\ \fB--service=\fP\fIservice\fP
One or more services can be registered on different URL paths:
.in +4
\fISERVICE\fP := <url-path> ':' \fIAPPLICATION\fP
.in

#ifdef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
There is a pre-defined \fIapplication\fP, 'LOGIN', which causes the
daemon to invoke
.B /bin/login
requesting the user's name and password, and starting his
login shell. This is the default option for the
.B root
user, if no
.B --service
was defined. Starting
.B /bin/login
requires
.B root
privileges.
#endif

There is
#ifdef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
another
#endif
#ifndef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
a
#endif
pre-defined \fIapplication\fP, 'SSH'.
#ifdef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
Instead of invoking
.BR /bin/login ,
it
#endif
#ifndef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
It
#endif
calls
.BR ssh .
This is the default
#ifdef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
option for unprivileged users,
#endif
#ifndef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
option,
#endif
if no
.B --service
was defined. This operation is available to both privileged and regular
users. If the optional \fIhost\fP parameter is omitted,
.B shellinaboxd
connects to
.BR localhost .

Alternatively, an \fIapplication\fP can be specified by providing a
\fIuser\fP description, a working directory, and a command line:
.in +4
#ifdef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
\fIAPPLICATION\fP := 'LOGIN' | 'SSH' [ ':' <host> ] |  \fIUSER\fP ':' \fICWD\fP ':' \fICMD\fP
#endif
#ifndef HAVE_BIN_LOGIN
\fIAPPLICATION\fP := 'SSH' [ ':' <host> ] |  \fIUSER\fP ':' \fICWD\fP ':' \fICMD\fP
#endif

#ifdef HAVE_PAM
.in
The keyword 'AUTH' indicates that the \fIuser\fP information should
be requested interactively, instead of being provided as part of the
\fIservice\fP description:
.in +4
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_PAM
\fIUSER\fP := 'AUTH' |
#endif
#ifndef HAVE_PAM
\fIUSER\fP :=
#endif
<username> ':' <groupname>
.in

The working directory can either be given as an absolute path, or it
can be the user's home directory:
.in +4
\fICWD\fP := 'HOME' : <dir>
.in

The command that
.B shellinaboxd
executes can either be specified as the 'SHELL' keyword, denoting the user's
default login shell, or an arbitrary command line:
.in +4
\fICMD\fP := 'SHELL' : <cmdline>
.in

The <cmdline> supports expansion of variables of the form ${VAR}.
Supported variables are:
.RS
.TP \w'${columns}\ \ 'u
.B ${columns}
number of columns.
.TP
.B ${gid}
numeric group id.
.TP
.B ${group}
group name.
.TP
.B ${home}
home directory.
.TP
.B ${lines}
number of rows.
.TP
.B ${peer}
name of remote peer.
.TP
.B ${realip}
value of HTTP header field 'X-Real-IP'.
.TP
.B ${uid}
numeric user id.
.TP
.B ${url}
the URL that serves the terminal session.
.TP
.B ${user}
user name.
.P
Other than the environment variables of
.BR $TERM ,
.B $COLUMNS,
.B $LINES,
.B $SHELLINABOX_PEERNAME,
.B $SHELLINABOX_REALIP
and
.BR $SHELLINABOX_URL,
services can have environment variables passed to them, by preceding
the <cmdline> with space separated variable assignments of the form
.IR KEY = VALUE .

The <cmdline> supports single and double quotes, as well as
backslashes for escaping characters in the familiar fashion.

Please note that when invoking
.B shellinaboxd
from a command line shell, additional quoting might be required to
prevent the shell from expanding the variables prior to passing them
to the daemon.

If no explicit
.B --service
has been requested,
.B shellinaboxd
defaults to attaching the default service to the root directory of the web
server. For
.BR root ,
this is
.BR /bin/login ,
and for unprivileged users, this is \fBssh localhost\fP. This is equivalent
to saying
.BR --service=/:LOGIN ,
or
.BR --service=/:SSH ,
respectively.

Please note that for SSH service to work properly, we need a running ssh server on
local system with enabled password authentication. If we are using <host> parameter,
same conditions must be true on that remote system.

.RE
#ifdef HAVE_OPENSSL
.TP
\fB-t\fP\ |\ \fB--disable-ssl\fP
By default,
.B shellinaboxd
redirectes all incoming HTTP requests to their equivalent HTTPS
URLs. If promoting of connections to encrypted SSL/TLS sessions is
undesired, this behavior can be disabled.

This option is also useful during testing or for deployment in trusted
intranets, if SSL certificates are unavailable.
#endif
.TP
\fB--disable-ssl-menu\fP
If the user should not be able to switch between HTTP and HTTPS modes, this
choice can be removed from the context menu. The user can still make this
choice by directly going to the appropriate URL.
.TP
\fB-q\fP\ |\ \fB--quiet\fP
Suppresses all messages to
.IR stderr .
This option is mutually exclusive with
.B --debug
and
.BR --verbose .
.TP
\fB-u\fP\ |\ \fB--user=\fP\fIuid\fP
If started as
.BR root ,
the server drops privileges by changing to
.BR nobody ,
unless the
.I uid
has been overridden by this option.

For more details, refer to the description of the
.B --group
option.
.TP
\fB--user-css=\fP\fIstyles\fP
The visual appearance of the terminal emulator can be customized
through user-selectable style sheets. These style sheets will show up
as options in the right-click context menu of the terminal emulator.

Styles sheet make up either independently selectable on/off options,
or multiple style sheets can be grouped together. When forming a group,
only one member of the group can be active at any given time. This is
used for multiple-choice options.

Multiple independent groups are separated by semicolons:
.in +4
\fISTYLES\fP := \fIGROUP\fP { ';' \fIGROUP\fP }*
.in

The members of a group are separated by commas:
.in +4
\fIGROUP\fP := \fIOPTION\fP { ',' OPTION }*
.in

Groups with exactly one member are used for options that can be
independently turned on and off.

Options include a human readable label that will be shown in the
context menu, followed by the name of the CSS file. They also must
include an indicator showing whether the option should initially be
turned on or turned off. Within a group, exactly one option should be
turned on:
.in +4
\fIOPTION\fP := <label> ':' [ '-' | '+' ] <css-file>
.in

The user's selection of options will be persisted in a cookie. This
means, the default settings of options as passed on the command line
only takes effect the very first time the user visits the terminal
emulator in his browser. On all subsequent visits, the user's
preferences take precedence.
.TP
\fB-v\fP\ |\ \fB--verbose\fP
Enables logging of
.IR Apache -style
log file to
.IR stderr .
This option is mutually exclusive with
.B --debug
and
.BR --quiet .
.TP
\fB--version\fP
Prints the version number of the binary and exits.
.SH CONFIGURATION
#ifndef DPKGBUILD
There are no configuration files or permanent settings for
.BR shell\%ina\%boxd .
#endif
#ifdef DPKGBUILD
Except for the options in
.I /etc/default/shellinabox
that are used when running the daemon as a system-wide service, and
except for the style sheet definitions in
.IR /etc/shellinabox ,
there are no other configuration options.
#endif

A small number of run-time configuration options are available from a
context menu that becomes available when clicking the right mouse
button. These options get persisted in a browser cookie.

Many sites already have a web server running and would like to
integrate
.B shellinaboxd
into their existing site. This is most commonly done by means of a
reverse-proxy entry for the main web server. For
.I Apache
this would require adding an option such as:
.in +4
 <Location /shell>
     ProxyPass  http://localhost:4200/
     Order      allow,deny
     Allow      from all
 </Location>
.in

If you are using a different web server, refer to that server's
documentation on how to configure reverse proxy operations.

When using a reverse proxy, the
.B --localhost-only
option would normally be enabled as well.
#ifdef DPKGBUILD
This can be done in
.IR /etc/default/shellinabox .
#endif
In addition, the
.B --disable-ssl
might also be considered depending on the exact configuration details
of the reverse proxy.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP \w'shellinaboxd\ 'u
.B shellinaboxd
Attaches a web-enabled login shell to
.IR https://localhost:4200/ .
If the user connected without SSL, the session will automatically be promoted.
Unless SSL certificates can be found in the current directory, the daemon will
automatically generate suitable self-signed certificates. If the command was
invoked by a non-\fBroot\fP user, the daemon uses
.B ssh
instead of
.B /bin/login
for the session.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t
Attaches a web-enabled login shell to
.I http://localhost:4200/
with SSL/TLS support disabled.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -f beep.wav:/dev/null
Runs all services with the audible-bell permanently disabled.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -s /:SSH:example.org
The terminal connects to a
.B ssh
session on
.IR example.org .
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -s /:AUTH:HOME:/bin/bash
Interactively request the user's name and password prior to launching
a Bourne shell. This command can be run by unprivileged users. But if
doing so, it only allows this particular user to log in.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -c certificates -u shellinabox -g shellinabox
If the
.B certificates
directory exists and is writable by the
.B shellinabox
user and group, self-signed SSL certificates will be generated in this
directory. This might require creating an appropriately named user first.
Running this command as
.B root
allows any user on the system to log in at
.BR http://localhost:4200/ .
Sessions will automatically be promoted to SSL/TLS.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -s /:LOGIN -s /who:nobody:nogroup:/:w
In addition to the login shell at
.IR http://localhost:4200 ,
show a list of currently logged in users when accessing
.IR http://localhost:4200/who .
This command must be run as
.B root
in order to be able to change to
.B nobody:nogroup
as requested by the service description.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -s '/:root:root:/:wy60 -c /bin/login'
Instead of the standard
.B ANSI/VT100
terminal, publish a
.B Wyse 60\*(Tm
terminal. Again, this command should be run as
.BR root .
.TP
#ifndef DPKGBUILD

#endif
#ifdef DPKGBUILD
.B shellinaboxd --css '/etc/shellinabox/options-available/00_White On Black.css'
#endif
Loads the
#ifndef DPKGBUILD
.B white-on-black.css
#endif
#ifdef DPKGBUILD
.B 00_White On Black.css
#endif
style sheet
#ifndef DPKGBUILD
from the current directory
#endif
and appends it to the built-in
.B styles.css
sheet. This causes the terminal to always render white text on a black
background.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd --user-css Normal:+black-on-white.css,Reverse:-white-on-black.css
Allow the user to select whether they want text to be rendered
normally or in reverse video. This command line option adds a new
entry to the right-click context menu.
#ifdef DPKGBUILD

If starting
.B shellinaboxd
as a system process, the
.I /etc/init.d/shellinabox
script looks in
.I /etc/shell\%in\%a\%box/op\%tions-\%en\%abled
for style sheets that should be added to the command line. See the
.I README
file in that directory for details on how to configure system-wide
options.
#endif
.P
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The daemon returns a non-zero exit code in case of failure. With the
exception of a small number of common error cases that are handled
explicitly, most errors result in printing a
.I \(dqCheck failed\(dq
message. This does not typically indicate a bug in the program but is
instead its normal way of reporting errors.

Common failure conditions are reusing a port that is already in use,
lack of sufficient privileges to run a service, failure to find
SSL/TLS certificates, and failure to write newly generated
certificates to the certification directory.
#ifdef DPKGBUILD
.SH FILES
.TP 10
.I /etc/default/shellinabox
The system-wide installation of
.B shellinaboxd
can be configured by editing this file. After making any changes, restart
the daemon with \fBsudo service shellinabox restart\fP.
.TP
.I /etc/shellinabox
This directory contains style sheets that will be used for the
.B --user-css
command line option, when running
.B shellinaboxd
as a system-wide service.
.TP
.I /etc/init.d/shellinabox
This is the system-wide service definition. Usually, there is no need to
edit this file.
.TP
.I /var/lib/shellinabox
This directory contains the certificate files that
.B shellinaboxd
uses when serving encrypted SSL sessions. If suitable files do not exist, yet,
it tries to populate the directory with self-signed certificates the first
time a particular certificate is needed. Over time, it should contain
\fBcertificate.pem\fP, \fBcertificate-localhost.pem\fP, and
\fBcertificate-\fP\fIHOSTNAME\fP\fB.pem\fP.
.TP
.I /var/run/shellinaboxd.pid
This file is created any time the system-wide service gets started.

.SH SECURITY
The daemon uses privilege separation techniques to allow it to drop
privileges early. It is aware of setuid flags and restricts some
operations when launched as a setuid application.

Despite these safety features, a bug could conceivably lead to a
determined attacker gaining elevated privileges. It is therefore
strongly discouraged to set the setuid flag on the binary.

The expected deployment would be from a system
.I rc
script launched by
.BR /sbin/init .
For extra security, the
.B --group
and
.B --user
options should be used to change to a dedicated user.

.SH BUGS
Due to browser limitations, some features might not be available to
users of all browsers.
.P
Konqueror does not allow for reliable interception of
.I CTRL
keys. If you press a key together with the
.I CTRL
modifier, it continues performing the browser's predefined behavior for
this particular key combination. In most cases, it also fails to report
the correct key to the terminal emulator. As a work-around, pressing
both the
.I CTRL
and the
.I WINDOWS
key sometimes works.
.P
Some browsers, most notably IE on Windows, disallow interception of
.I ALT
keys and always interpret these keys as menu accelerators. As a
work-around, many UNIX applications allow pressing
.IR ESC ,
instead of
.IR ALT .
.P
When using non-US keyboard layouts, some browser do not allow for
reliably determining shifted
.I ALT
keys. Please report these cases if they turn out to be a problem, as
work-arounds might be possible.
.P
Access to the native clipboard is typically not possible. Instead, an
internal clipboard accessible from the right-button context menu is used
for all but IE.
.P
Some browsers restrict the number of concurrent connections to a
server. This restricts how many AJAX terminals can be opened
simultaneously. If this becomes a problem, users can typically
reconfigure their browsers to raise the limit.
.P
There have been reports of the VLC plugin on Linux/x86_64 crashing Firefox
when the browser page gets reloaded. Setting the
.B --no-beep
option eliminates all references to VLC and thus appears to work around
this crash.
